085810043	YET YOU STILL HAVE MEETINGS
085810056	AND LOOK WHAT A VIEW
085810086	I WASH I COULD SLEEP
085810120	WE HAD A LETTER FROM HIM THIS MORNING
085810152	IT WOULD BE FUNNY SO FUNNY
085810167	THAT IS TO SAY I'M GOING TO SLEEP
085840020	IT WAS ONLY ONE BY THE PAST THAT MORNING
085840040	I KNOW THAT MY DEAR BOY
085840072	HE MAY BE ABLE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
085840086	AND IN THAT YOU ANSWERED ME
085840092	THIS DESK IS YOUR ROCK SIR
085840117	HOW BIG IS YOUR HOUSE
085840141	IF I GIVE THE WORD YOU STAY ON
085840167	HE SEEMED A VERY GOOD WOMAN NEAR FIFTY YEARS GOOD
090880060	YOU ARE NO LONGER KIND
090880086	WILL YOU BE READY AT ONCE NOW
090880093	I MADE MY VOICE SOUNDS CARELESS
090880120	THINK OF ME AS THROUGH I WERE YOU SISTER
090880130	DO YOU REALLY AND TRULY SAY SO
090880140	NOW LET ME HAVE YOUR ATTENTION
090880145	IT WAS AS STILL AS DEATH
090880157	THE NAMES REMAINING WERE CALLED IN THE SAME MANNER
091010017	HE IS BURNING TO HAVE AT SOMEBODY
091010050	HE SENDS ME FOR THAT PURPOSE AND HERE I AM
091010063	WE NEED NOT STAY UNLESS YOU LIKE
091010082	HE IS RICH MAN
091010107	IF YOU NOT MORE THAN TEN I WILL MAKE FIGHT
091010127	THERE SEEMED A WALL IN FRONT OF HIM
091010138	COVERED WITH SHAME SHE COULD MAKE NO ANSWER
091010149	EACH MAN HAD A PIECE OF SOAP AND A TOWEL
091070001	THE LAST STAGE WAS REACHED
091070040	BECAUSE EVEN NOW THINGS MIGHT TURN OUT DIFFERENTLY
091070056	THAT WAS THE REASON OF HIS GOING
091070074	AND THE WHOLE COURT WAS PLACED UNDER HIS ORDERS
091070108	I WOULD TRUST HIM AS I COULD TRUST MYSELF
091070138	MAYBE A LOT OF PEOPLE
091070142	YOU START A QUESTION AND IT'S LIKE STARTING A STONE
091070163	AND I WOULD HAVE KISSED YOU
091070175	I SEE YOU ALL SWING IN A ROPE
091180035	YES YOU WILL SEE HERE HAVE SPEECH WITH HERE
091180044	WHERE YOU NOT ABLE TO BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM
091180064	DO YOU EVER TRY ME
091180078	BECAUSE I SEE YOUR BODY ACTING IN A CERTAIN WAY
091180101	LAST TIME I WAS YOUR JEST
091180133	HERE IS AN INSTANCE OF THIS FEELING
091180159	THERE MUST BE AN END OF THIS
091180163	HE CAN ALMOST STAND ON HIS LEGS
095530011	SHE WALKED THROUGH THE HOUSE
095530028	BUT MIGHT NOT HE GET ANOTHER LESSON FROM THEM
095530059	WHAT A GREATLY IT WAS
095530082	HE WAS FOR MOMENTS TURNED TO STONE BEFORE IT
095530085	I HAVE HOWEVER FOUND THE FOLLOWING
095530118	BUT WHAT IS THE POINT OF IT
095530152	HE COULD PAY NO ATTENTION
095530161	I KNOW THAT WAS UNDERSTANDING
095550043	AND THERE IS WORSE BEHIND
095550046	HE SITS BY HER SIDE FOR HOURS
095550073	SO FAR THEY WERE IN PERFECT AGREEMENT
095550081	AM I WORSE THAN YOU
095550100	FROM THE COURT THE NEWS SOON REACHED THE TOWN
095550116	IT IS ALWAYS SAFE TO TRUST HIM
095550143	ALL THE SAME YOU MUST NOT REMAIN HERE
095550148	AND THAT MAKES IT WORSE
095580012	SHE WAS JUST IN TIME TO HEAR THE DIRECTION
095580039	IF THIS WERE TRUE WHO COULD BE UNHAPPY
095580067	WHEN YOU ASKED ME TO HIDE YOU
095580097	I THOUGHT YOU WERE SURE THAT HE WAS GUILTY
095580101	BUT THIS IS ASKING FOR THE WORLD AND NOTHING LESS
095580128	IT IS YOUR DUTY MY SON
095580157	SHE IS A GIRL WITH A LOT OF TALENT
096010001	THERE WAS NO WAY SHE COULD USE IT
096010004	SHE OPENED HER EYES STARING UP AT HIM
096010007	YOU MAY NOT WANT TO KNOW
096010009	AND THEN THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
096010012	IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH IF THEY HAD ONLY THOUGHT
096010015	I TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK THE DOG OVER
096010019	THEY WALKED THE REST OF THE DAY AND ALL NIGHT
096010021	HE SHRUGGED ME OFF LIKE I WAS NOTHING
096080003	YOU MUST NOT THINK OF THE PAST NOW
096080006	THEY WERE ALREADY IN AND SEEMED LIKE THEY SAW NOTHING
096080009	BUT STILL I WOULD DO MY BEST
096080012	AND THERE SHE WAS WITH ANOTHER MAN
096080014	IT WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT
096080017	SHE CLOSED HER EYES AND THOUGHT BACK
096080022	HE REACHED FOR HER HAND SHE LET HIM TAKE IT
096080024	THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT WERE LOOKING AT US
096080027	YOU HAVE TO CHANGE WITH THEM OR BE LEFT BEHIND
096100002	BUT HOW COULD SHE HAVE NOT KNOWN THAT
096100005	SHOULD I KNOW HER AGAIN IF I SAW HER
096100007	COULD THIS GIRL BE LIKE HIM IN SOME WAY
096100010	SHE JUST NEVER WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT EVEN NOW
096100012	NONE OF THEM HAD THOUGHT TO LOOK BEHIND THE DOOR
096100015	HE TURNED HIS HEAD AWAY FROM HER
096100017	THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR ME
096100020	I ASKED TO BE SURE
096120002	I WANT TO SEE HIM MYSELF
096120005	HE HAD THOUGHT THEY WOULD NEVER COME BACK
096120009	IF SHE WANTED TO SHE COULD BE VERY POPULAR
096120011	BUT WE LOOKED LIKE THAT A LONG LONG TIME AGO
096120014	THIS WAS THE PLACE ALL RIGHT
096120016	HE WAS STILL AT HOME
096120019	HE WAS FACE TO FACE WITH THE GIRL
096170001	SHE WAS JUST LIKE HE WAS
096170004	YOU MAY NOT BE WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE
096170007	AND ONCE MORE SHE WAS ALL HIS OWN
096170010	THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY AROUND IT
096170012	WE ARE GOING TO DO NOTHING ABOUT IT
096170015	HE TURNED AND ASKED THEM
096170020	SHE WAS LOOKING AWAY FROM HIM AT THE FIRE
096170023	I LEFT THIS PLACE BECAUSE OF HIM
096180001	AND SHE WAS INTIMATE WITH HIM AS AT FIRST
096180005	HE COULD NEVER SEE HER BEFORE
096180008	WHAT DO YOU THINK WHAT CAN BE THERE
096180010	THAT WAS JUST HOW SHE WAS
096180012	AS IF SHE HAD SOMETHING ON HER MIND
096180015	WE COULD PUT YOU IN A WORLD OF HURT
096180017	SHE LET GO OF HIS HAND AND RUBBED HER EYES
096180020	AND THEN THERE WAS AN END OF IT
096180022	HE HAD CALLED THEM THAT HIMSELF IN HIS DAY
096220003	SHE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT
096220005	BUT WHAT IF WHAT THEY WERE DOING WAS RIGHT
096220008	THIS WAS NO TIME TO THINK ABOUT THE REAL WORLD
096220010	BUT IT CAN DO SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT
096220013	I ASKED IF THEY WERE IN A FIGHT OR SOMETHING
096220015	HE PUT HER DOWN AND PATTED HER ON THE HEAD
096220018	SHE TURNED AWAY WITH A LITTLE WAVE OF THE HAND
096220020	WHAT WAS HE LIKE IN PERSON
096230004	IT WAS JUST A PERSON
096230008	THE TIME OF THE DAY
096230010	AND I NEVER THOUGHT A THING
096230013	HOW LONG WAS HE GOING TO BE HERE
096230015	THEN SHE TURNED TO ALL OF US
096230018	WE MUST THINK OF THE GOOD AND NOT THE EVIL
096230020	HE PUT HIS HAND ON THE KNOB AND OPENED IT
096260003	IT WAS JUST YOU LAST TIME
096260005	BUT HOW WOULD THEY GO ABOUT IT
096260008	NOW THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO
096260011	HE HAD NOTHING BUT THIS PLACE
096260014	I NEED TO BE HERE
096260016	I HAD TO FIND A DIFFERENT BACK DOOR
096260019	IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE WHO IT WAS
096260021	AND THERE WAS AN END OF IT
096290002	WHAT I DO KNOW IS THIS
096290005	THEN IT WOULD ALL BE OVER
096290007	THERE WAS ONE RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME
096290009	I THOUGHT FOR SURE SHE WOULD SAY SOMETHING
096290012	THE BOY LOOKED FROM THE HAND TO HER
096290015	SHE ASKED LOOKING UP AT ME
096290018	THIS WAS THE WAY IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE
096290021	AND THE FIRST THOUGH IN MY HEAD WAS
096310001	HE COULD BUT WHAT WOULD HE DO
096310003	THERE WAS SOMETHING IN FRONT OF HER
096310006	THIS IS ALL I CAN SAY
096310008	HE TURNED HIS HEAD TO LOOK AT THEM
096310011	HE ALWAYS SAW IF SHE WANTED HIM NOT TO
096310013	WHAT WOULD THEY BE LIKE TO WORK WITH
096310016	THAT WAS AS MUCH AS HE WOULD GIVE HER
096310018	I THINK IT WILL DO US ALL SOME GOOD
096330003	HE LOOKED AT HER AND TURNED AWAY
096330006	IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE ONE PERSON
096330008	YOU NEED TO COME WITH ME
096330010	THEY HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE
096330013	BUT HOW CAN SHE TELL WHO IT WAS
096330015	THE GIRL WALKED IN AND LOOKED AROUND
096330018	THAT DAY WAS THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM
096330020	BUT THEN AGAIN THIS WAS HER HOUSE
096330023	IT WAS AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FRONT DOOR
096350007	SHE WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HIM
096350010	THE OTHER AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
096350012	HE ASKED IF I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MY FATHER
096350015	IF IT BE SO I HAD BETTER GO
096350018	I AM SURE YOU CAN DO IT
096350021	BUT THEN I THOUGHT THERE WAS LITTLE NEED
096350024	IT WAS NOT HER PLACE TO SAY ANYTHING
096350027	SHE TURNED TO FACE THE MAN
096400002	NOT A LIVING CREATURE WAS VISIBLE
096400007	WE WILL TAKE TURNS IN WRITING EACH CHAPTER
096400010	THEY WERE SILVER WITH NO PUPIL
096400014	WAITING FOR WHAT SHE THOUGHT
096400018	PLEASE FORGIVE ME MY FRIEND
096400021	EVERY MINUTE SEEMED LIKE AN HOURS
096400024	BUT THIS WANTS FARTHER EXPLANATION
096400028	IT'S ALMOST PAST YOUR BED TIME
096470003	A THIRD FINISHED WELL THERE YOU HAVE IT
096470007	WERE THESE YOUNG PEOPLE EVIL
096470010	IF THAT EVER HAPPENS THAT IS
096470013	WOMAN NO IT'S ALL RIGHT
096470015	THE FIRST MAY BE THUS EXPLAINED
096470018	ANYWAY THANKS FOR YOUR HELP
096470020	MAYBE WE SHOULD GET SOME CAKE
096470023	HIS HEAD HURT EVEN WORSE
